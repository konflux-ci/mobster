# Generate OCI Image

This utility allows users to generate SBOMs related to Container Images.

## Architecture

The scripts accepts any number of SBOMs generated by SYFT and at most one SBOM
generated by Hermeto (previously known as Cachi2), with the requirement that
at least one SBOM is provided in total. It combines these SBOMs
and takes them as a context of the built image.

The script also parses a JSON-ified Dockerfile of the image, parses its
content and determines which base images were used to build the image.
It identifies builder images as well as a _parent image_ which is the
latest image in the Dockerfile (or the base image for the stage identified
by the build target).

Additionally, you can also supply additional builder images on top of those
already parsed from the Dockerfile.

All provided SBOMs must be in the same specification! This script does not
support combining SPDX and CycloneDX SBOMs.

## Usage

```bash
mobster --verbose  generate oci-image \
--from-syft tests/sbom/test_merge_data/cyclonedx/syft-sboms/pip-e2e-test.bom.json \
--from-syft tests/sbom/test_merge_data/cyclonedx/syft-sboms/ubi-micro.bom.json \
--from-hermeto tests/sbom/test_merge_data/cyclonedx/cachi2.bom.json \
--image-pullspec quay.io/foobar/examplecontainer:v10 \
--image-digest sha256:1 \
--parsed-dockerfile-path tests/data/dockerfiles/somewhat_believable_sample/parsed.json \
--dockerfile-target build \
--additional-base-image quay.io/ubi9:latest@sha256:123456789012345678901234567789012
```

## List of arguments
- `--from-syft` -- points to an SBOM file (in a JSON format) created by Syft, can be used multiple times
- `--from-hermeto` -- points to an SBOM file (in a JSON format) created by Hermeto
- `--image-pullspec` -- the pullspec of the image processed in the format `<registry>/<repository>:<tag>`
- `--image-digest` -- the digest of the image processed in the format `sha256:<digest value>`
- `--parsed-dockerfile-path` -- points to a dockerfile processed by `dockerfile-json`
- `--base-image-digest-file` -- points to a file with digests for images used in Dockerfile.
  if omitted, the references will be fetched via `oras`. The expected format of the file is
  `<registry>/<repository>:<tag> <registry>/<repository>:<tag>@sha256:<digest>`
- `--dockerfile-target` -- if a build target was used for multi-stage build, use this argument to specify the build target
- `--additional-base-images` -- optionally add references to other build images outside the parsed Dockerfile.
  expects the format `<registry>/<repository>:<tag>@sha256:<digest value>`
- `--contextualize` -- Allows SBOM contextualization (see [Contextual SBOM](#contextual-sbom))
- `--output` -- where to save the SBOM. prints it to STDOUT if this is not specified


## Contextual SBOM

Contextual SBOM is a feature that establishes relationships between container images and their parent
(base) or builder images in the software supply chain. Instead of treating each
image as isolated, it creates a hierarchical view showing how packages flow from
parent or builder images to child images.


* Feature will be released gradually. Planned features:
    * ✅ **Contextual SBOM for non-hermetic build**
        * identification of the base image content in component in non-hermetic build
        * achieved by matching packages from the base image SBOM to the component
          SBOM and marking their origin with relationships
    * ⏳ **Builder content contextualization**
        * identification of the content copied from multistage build stages to component
        * acquired by generating an SBOM from content copied from builder images
          and merged into the final SBOM to indicate the origin of that content
    * ⏳ **Contextual SBOM for hermetic build**
        * differentiation of the base image content and component content in hermetic build
        * assembled from base image content, hermeto content and - in multistage builds -
          builder content


## Requirements for executing Contextual SBOM workflow
* Base image of the component must be built by konflux and must have SBOM attached
* Attached base image SBOM must be in SPDX format
* --contextualize flag is present

If requirements are not fulfilled, legacy SBOM (not contextualized) will be produced.


## Functional breakdown
* Feature profoundly changes relationship structure of the SBOM
    * **Legacy SBOM:** Relationships capture only first base image as component ancestor.
      All package relationships point to component. There is no concept of the base/parent
      image content, origin of the packages is unknown.
    * **Contextual SBOM:** Relationships capture all base images as component ancestors in
      ordered chain up to last non-contextualized ancestor. Package relationships point
      to those ancestors (or component itself) indicating origin of the package.
* Mechanism of Contextual SBOM is different for the hermetic and non-hermetic build.
* Comparing to legacy SBOM, **all packages remain present**; none are removed.
* Gradual changes will remain **backward compatible** and will build on each other,
  resulting in a richer and more accurate SBOM (e.g., base image content identification
  in non-hermetic builds will later be enhanced with builder content for components with
  multistage builds, forming the foundation for contextual SBOMs in hermetic builds).
* Contextual SBOMs are designed to be **self-assembling** and this works across hermetic and
  non-hermetic builds interchangeably and also with contextualized or non-contextualized
  parent SBOM-s. 
  It means that built component can be contextualized by its parent SBOM regardless if parent
  SBOM is sourced from hermetic or non-hermetic build, or if it is contextualized or
  non-contextualized.
* Contextual SBOM mechanism can be disabled by _not_ including `--contextualize` flag in
  `mobster generate oci-image` command - in that case, legacy SBOM will be produced.


### Contextual SBOM for non-hermetic build
Contextual SBOM for non-hermetic build is achieved by generating syft-based component SBOM,
downloading a SBOM of the base image (if exists and has SPDX format) and matching packages
from parent to component according to the chosen identifiers.
`CONTAINS` relationships of the matched packages are modified in component SBOM indicating
source of origin shifting relationships from component to parent or grandparents.

_Warning:_ Matching mechanism is not perfect, because SPDX specification is missing
consistent unique identifier across different packages and thus Contextual SBOM for
non-hermetic build is for now the best effort considering differentiation between content
added by component and its parent content. This means that not all content from parent
can be identified in component. This might be improved in future versions.
For now for every such Contextual SBOM document produced in non-hermetic build one can say:
- this portion of the identified packages is sourced from parent (or grandparents)
  of the component
- packages that were not matched could be sourced either from parent (or
  grandparents) or they were installed in component (in fact, this is current
  state in legacy SBOM)


### Builder content contextualization
Builder content is any content copied from builder images in multistage builds. This content
will be identified by inspection of build layers in local buildah build artifacts storage.
From this content, an SPDX SBOM is generated. The relationships will describe the origin of
copied content from specific builder images, and this partial SBOM is subsequently merged
into the final Contextual SBOM. This content;
- will be produced only within contextual SBOM workflow for components with
  multistage build
- will be deduplicated against Contextual SBOM from non-hermetic build (builder packages
  should be already captured in syft component scan)
- will serve as last step for Contextual SBOM for hermetic build enablement


### Contextual SBOM for hermetic build
Contextual SBOM for hermetic build is not produced by matching of the packages between two
SPDX documents but assembled from two (single-stage builds) or three (multi-stage builds)
SBOM-s:
1. Downloaded parent content (if not available, contextual SBOM is skipped and legacy SBOM
   will be produced) is defining content of the base image. Might be previously
   contextualized or not.
2. Hermeto content is representation of content installed in component on the top of base
   image (not including builder content - hermeto cannot see it)
3. [In case of multistage builds] - Builder content is defining content copied from multistage
   build stages to the component.


Assembling SBOM this way is reducing dependence on syft - no syft scan has to be performed on
built component, no deduplication is done with hermeto SBOM afterward. Another benefit of hermetic
build contextual SBOM-s is, the more ancestors of a component are built hermetically, the less
Syft-detected content will appear in the component’s SBOM.
Warning: It is important to understand that a downloaded parent SBOM content may be affected by
the component’s build process (some packages may be removed during build, for example `dnf update
package` will update `package` but also may remove other packages by resolving dependency tree).
This could occasionally result false positives in the resulting SBOM sourced from parent content.
